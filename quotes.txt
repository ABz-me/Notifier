Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.
